# Kafka Mastery Learning Plan

## Overview
This project is dedicated to learning and mastering Apache Kafka through hands-on experience. The plan is organized into progressive steps, each with clear goals, topics, and practical exercises. As you work through each stage, you can check off completed items, add notes, and expand the plan as needed.

---

## 1. Foundations & Setup
- **Goal:** Understand what Kafka is, its core concepts, and set up your first Kafka cluster.
- **Topics:**
  - What is Kafka? (Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Producers, Consumers, Zookeeper)
  - Kafka use cases and architecture
- **Hands-on:**
  - Run a single-node Kafka cluster using Docker
  - Use Kafka CLI tools to create topics, produce, and consume messages
- **Resources:** Official Kafka documentation, Confluent tutorials

---

## 2. Producers & Consumers
- **Goal:** Learn how to send and receive data with Kafka.
- **Topics:**
  - Producer and Consumer APIs
  - Message serialization (String, JSON, Avro)
  - Consumer groups and offsets
- **Hands-on:**
  - Write a simple producer and consumer in your preferred language (Python/Java/Node.js)
  - Experiment with different message formats
  - Observe consumer group behavior

---

## 3. Kafka Internals & Reliability
- **Goal:** Understand how Kafka ensures durability and fault tolerance.
- **Topics:**
  - Partitions and replication
  - Leader election
  - Message retention and cleanup policies
- **Hands-on:**
  - Simulate broker failures and observe how Kafka recovers
  - Configure retention policies and test message expiry

---

## 4. Advanced Messaging Patterns
- **Goal:** Explore advanced Kafka messaging and processing patterns.
- **Topics:**
  - Exactly-once semantics
  - Idempotent producers
  - Transactions in Kafka
- **Hands-on:**
  - Implement exactly-once delivery
  - Use transactions to produce/consume atomically

---

## 5. Kafka Streams & Connect
- **Goal:** Learn about real-time stream processing and integration.
- **Topics:**
  - Kafka Streams API for processing data
  - Kafka Connect for data integration (JDBC, Elasticsearch, etc.)
- **Hands-on:**
  - Build a simple stream processing app (e.g., word count)
  - Use Kafka Connect to ingest/export data from/to external systems

---

## 6. Monitoring, Security, and Tuning
- **Goal:** Operate Kafka in production-like scenarios.
- **Topics:**
  - Monitoring with JMX, Prometheus, Grafana
  - Securing Kafka (SSL, SASL, ACLs)
  - Performance tuning
- **Hands-on:**
  - Set up basic monitoring dashboards
  - Enable SSL for your cluster

---

## 7. Capstone Project
- **Goal:** Apply everything youâ€™ve learned in a real-world scenario.
- **Ideas:**
  - Build a mini data pipeline (e.g., ingest logs, process, and visualize results)
  - Integrate Kafka with a web app for real-time updates
